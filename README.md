# J---Compiler
J-- compiler added to over the course of a semester

In the submitted folder of each project is a .tar file. These are the final versions submited for each project. 
The tests in the submitted folder were used to check the correctness of each project.

The report#.txt file in each submitted folder states the files I edited, progress I made, and issues I ran into, etc. 
These are basically the README file for each project/homework.


The j--.zip file is the base j-- compipiler which slowly gets added to in each project.

This was ran on an ElementaryOS in an Oracle VM VirtualBox. Editing the files using the Code application and testing them in the terminal.
