3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types): I've edited JArrayExpression, 
   JArrayInitializer, JLiteralLong, JLiteralDouble, JBinaryExpression, 
   JVariable, Context and Type. I use theappendix in the book to find what 
   cases I need to add to the literal files while using LiteralInt as a model. 
   I just added checks for Long and Double where Int was and added 
   LLOAD/LSTORE and DLOAD/DSTORE there. I added a method in Context for the +2 
   offset of Long and Double. Types for Long and Double, unboxed and boxed and 
   descriptorFor in the Type file. Error Register 1/2 wrong type. I've checked 
   several areas and checked the Piazza questions to see where I went wrong. So 
   far I can't find the exact problem but it doesn't seem to areas mentioned on 
   piazza especially when -pa and -v looks correct. Feedback/Critics would be 
   apprecited.

   Problem 2 (Operators): I mostly changed JAssignment, JBinaryExpression, 
   JBooleanBinaryExpression, UnaryExpression, and Type. Checks for Long and 
   Double added to analyze and codegen of several methods in UnaryExpression. 
   Same for JAssignment, JBinaryExpression and JBooleanBinaryExpression. Of 
   course while making these edits, I use the appendix in the back to check 
   what I can and need to add. Solved.
   
   Problem 3 (Conditional Expression): Solved. I only edited analyze and codegen
   of JTernaryOp in JTernaryExpression. For codegen, I just copied the codegen 
   of JIfStatement without checking for null for the branching expressions. 
   In analyze, I check if the first expression (condition) if it was a boolean.
   For the second and third expressions, I checked to see if they were the same 
   type as each other instead of checking if they're both integers. Then 
   set type to second expression type.

   Problem 4 (Switch Statement): Not Solved. I made changes to Parser and the 
   respected SwitchStatement files. I've changed these around a lot try to get 
   through it. I skipped this problem for a majority of my time spent on this 
   project knowing it'll be the most difficult problem. I have no idea where 
   to use the hint so I went about this with a different approach. I think
   the error here lies in how I'm added labels to branch out too and should 
   probably try a different approach. I started working on this towards the end
   of the dealine and just decided to keep trying it out with this way and see 
   if I can make progress. 

   Problem 5 (Do-while Statement): Literal sought error possibly due to 
   the same error from homework 3. I've made some edits to the respected file. 
   Unfortunately I am unable to check if I edited codegen and analyze correctly.
   Direction of error would be apprecited.

   Problem 6 (For Statement): Literal sought error possibly due to 
   the same error from homework 3. I've made some edits to the respected file. 
   I also tried making changes to Parser.java where have(FOR) is to see if this 
   was the case. Can't check corrected ness of codegen and analyze.
   Direction of error would be apprecited.
   
   Problem 7 (Exception Handlers): Not Solved. I've made minor edits to 
   JFinallyStatement and JCatchStatement. I focused most of attention on 
   JTryStatement. 

   Problem 8 (Interface Type Declarations): Not Solved. I've mainly edited 
   JInterfaceDeclaration and tried editing Parser.java to see if anything there
   was causing the NullPointerException. I use JClassDeclaration as model and 
   try following it very closely. I also made minor changes to that file to 
   see if the problem was cause by something there. This is the problem I spent
   the second least amount of time.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   ----               ------       -------------
   Derek              Classmate    I just texted him asking what files he edited
                                   for problem 1 to determine where my problem 
                                   could be. He was also having the same issue. 
                                   This was when I started the project. He 
                                   misundstood what the register 1/2 wrong type
                                   was exactly and was not any help with this 
                                   problem.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
   
   Quite a difficult project with a steep escalation in difficulty from the 
   previous project. It was expected considering the amount of time we were 
   given for this project. Part of the lack of commitment to this project on my
   part was due to me being in the process trying to quit my job this time 
   around. I can't say I learned much from this project and felt overwhelm 
   looking at each file to see where I need to edit or where I went wrong on 
   older projects. The less amount of instructions/guidance on this pdf also did
   not help when looking for where I need to edit. When You instruction what 
   files we need edit or not edit at all on the previous pdfs was a huge help 
   to me. I did start this project late just like my other projects but this one
   requirement my undivided attention even during our days off. 
   
   Like I commented on one of the previous projects, there is potential 
   artificial difficulty for errors one makes on previous projects. This time, 
   the issues I had on JForStatement and JDoWhileStatement from project 3 came 
   back to haunt me on this project. I download the projects after they have 
   been graded and when I checked project 3, there was no feedback at all to 
   try to fix those errors. A potentially way to conduct these projects is 
   how Ron Cheung gives projects for CS341 and CS444. When he gave projects,
   He would tell students to either use their previously submitted project or 
   the provided solution whenever we went on to the next project. Which was a 
   way to give everyone a clean start for each project. But at the same time, 
   this could potentially give students less incentive to learn certain projects
   or try to cheat by posting solutions online or ask students from previous
   semester. I believe he did say he would stop this if this became the case. 
   In fact, I see similarities between how you and him conduct your course. He
   does not take attendance which did make students show up to class less. You
   do take attendance which gives students more incentive to come to class. 
   Perhaps you two should talk to possibly improve student efficiency in your 
   courses.
